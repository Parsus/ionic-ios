A more conformant iOS theme for Ionic

The **Ionic iOS** theme is designed to help developers and designers adhere closer to [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/) by providing a theme which replicates native [UIKit views and controls.](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/UIKitUICatalog/) Classes are named closely to their iOS counterparts to encourage awareness of iOS internals in the event you ever decide to go native.
